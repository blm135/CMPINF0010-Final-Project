Based off of the data collected, we concluded that Allegheny Center is the "best neighborhood" in Pittsburgh. I have only been to a few, but my personal favorite neighborhood has to be Shadyside. This is primarily because I love the stores and restaurants in the area. Even though this makes it more desirable to me, it lacks some of the factors that "better neighborhoods" have. Despite having the second largest population, it's rank for income was average. Also, it's rank for playgrounds per person was low. Eventhough it still ranked higher on the overall list, it's clear why it isn't the "best neighborhood".
